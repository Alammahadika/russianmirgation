### Collection News (Scraped)

```py 
import feedparser

rss_url = ""  # URL feed
feed = feedparser.parse(rss_url)

for entry in feed.entries:
    print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Link: {entry.link}")
    print(f"Published: {entry.published}\n")

rss_urls = ["URL News"]

entries = []

for url in rss_urls:
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    entries.extend(feed.entries)

print(f"Total articles retrieved: {len(entries)}")

for entry in entries[:0]:  # collection news quantity
    print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
